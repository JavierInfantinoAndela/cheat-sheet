## Popular Data Engineering Stacks

### Lambda Architecture Stack
- Batch Layer: Apache Hadoop (MapReduce, HDFS), Apache Spark, Apache Flink
- Serving Layer: Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, Apache Phoenix
- Speed Layer: Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, Apache Samza

#### Why use
Provides a fault-tolerant, scalable, and real-time data processing and serving architecture that can handle both batch and stream processing.

#### When to use
The Lambda architecture is best suited for use cases where both real-time and batch processing are required. This includes applications where low-latency data processing is necessary, such as fraud detection or real-time analytics.
